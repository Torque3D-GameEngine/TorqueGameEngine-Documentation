        <p>The Inspector tool allows you to select an object and
        manipulate all of its script-exposed parameters via text
        boxes, spinners, radio-buttons, checkboxes, etc. These
        parameters will vary based on the object. Later in this
        guide, we will examine specific parameters for water,
        terrain, the character, the sky, etc. Now, for the purpose
        of learning about this tool, we will work with a simpler
        object, namely the SpawnSphere. The purpose of this object
        is unimportant at this time. The key thing is that it is
        easily located and manipulated.</p>

        <p>To begin, look directly overhead. You should see a gray
        object. Select it and you should have a view similar to
        this:</p>

        <div class="mediaobject">
          <p><img src="images/worldinspector.png"></p>
        </div>

        <p>Taking a quick inventory of the screen elements, we see
        the World Editor Menu at the top, the 3D World-View window
        which takes up nearly two-thirds of the screen, the World
        Editor Tree window in the upper right, and finally the
        World Editor Inspector window in the lower right.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section"><a name="missioneditor.inspector.tree"></a><a name = "HeaderLink2"></a>        World Editor Tree</h2>

        <p>Before we jump into the relatively straightforward World
        Editor Inspector let's discuss the World Editor Tree and
        some important organization features it provides.</p>

        <p>First, expand the list in the World Editor Tree Window.
        The initial list is completely collapsed which doesn't do
        us a lot of good when we're trying to manipulate
        objects.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section"><a name=
        "missioneditor.inspector.simgroups"></a><a name = "HeaderLink3"></a>SimGroups</h2>

        <p>At this point, you may be asking, <em>what is a
        SimGroup</em>? Subsequent chapters in the Tech School
        section will get into the nitty gritty details about
        SimGroups, SimSets, and SimObjects. For now we'll simply
        describe SimGroups as a means by which the engine organizes
        objects. This is both useful from a organization sense,
        i.e. knowing where to find things while you are editing,
        and equally useful, for scripting purposes. By pre-defining
        a consistent set of SimGroups and by organizing your
        objects within them, your current job as a mission/level
        designer will be greatly simplified. Your script writers
        will thank you too. If that is your job to, then pat
        yourself on the back. Good Job!</p>

        <p>As can be seen from the current view of the World Editor
        Tree SimGroups can be nested within SimGroups as well as
        can particular entities (SimObjects). In fact, every
        mission entity is present in this list and will be found
        nested within a SimGroup.</p>

        <p>So, how exactly do we place objects within a SimGroup?
        Let's find out. First, make a duplicate copy of the
        SpawnSphere. We already have it selected, so all you need
        to do is type: CTRL + C (to copy) followed by CTRL + V (to
        paste). Alternately, you can use the Edit Menu ? Copy/Paste
        operations.</p>

        <p>Now that you've created a new SpawnSphere, you need to
        locate it in the World Editor Tree.</p>

        <div class="mediaobject">
          <p><img src="images/spawnsphere.png"></p>
        </div>

        <p>Hmm? If you've followed the instructions above, you will
        find the new SpawnSphere at the bottom of the tree. Hmmm,
        now we would much rather have it in the PlayerDropPoints -
        SimGroup with the rest of the SpawnSpheres. So, let's
        manually move this one to the correct spot and then learn
        how to place objects in the right SimGroup the first
        time.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h3 class="section"><a name=
          "missioneditor.inspector.simgroups.moving"></a><a name = "HeaderLink4"></a>Moving           Existing Objects Into A SimGroup (Add-Group or Instant           Group)</h3>

          <p>The new SpawnSphere should already be selected, but if
          it isn't, please click on it to select it. Now, use the
          slider on the right side of the World Editor Tree Window
          and find the PlayerDropsPoints-SimGroup. Select this as
          the Add-Group through the key/mouse combination: ALT +
          RightClick. The Add-Group should now be selected with a
          gray background:</p>

          <div class="mediaobject">
            <p><img src="images/simgroup.jpg"></p>
          </div>

          <p>Now, select the menu item: World -&gt; Add Selection
          to Instant Group. Viola! The SpawnSphere is in the
          PlayerDropPoints - SimGroup.</p>

          <div class="mediaobject">
            <p><img src="images/simgroup1.jpg"></p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h3 class="section"><a name=
          "missioneditor.inspector.simgroups.creating"></a><a name = "HeaderLink5"></a>Creating           Objects in a Pre-existing SimGroup(Add-Group)</h3>

          <p>OK, so that was a hassle. How do we get objects to
          place in the correct SimGroup when we create them?
          Simple. You already have a SpawnSphere in your
          copy-buffer and you already have the Add-Group selected
          (see above). Paste another Spawn sphere and it should
          show up in the PlayerDropPoints - SimGroup. Easy as pie!
          The trick to select your instant group before pasting
          objects and they will automatically be placed in that
          SimGroup.</p>

          <p>OK, now let's address the World Editor Inspector. This
          is of course, the window from which this tool gets its
          name. The purpose of this window is to allow you to <em>
          inspect</em> and modify parameters for individual
          objects. If you play around a bit and click on different
          objects, you will begin to see that different object
          types have different parameters. For now, we'll address
          the more common values, adding new values, and finish off
          with some tips on using the interface effectively. We
          will leave a detailed inspection of individual objects'
          parameters for the <em>Specific Mission Objects</em>
          chapter in Tech School.</p>

          <div class="section">
            <h4 class="section"><a name=
            "missioneditor.inspector.simgroups.inspector.commonfields"></a><a name = "HeaderLink8"></a>            Inspector - Common Fields</h4>

            <p>By far, the most common fields are:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Position (X,Y,Z) - Three floating point values
                representing the coordinates of the selected object
                in world space.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Rotation (Xm,Ym,Zm,A) - Four floating point
                values where the first three are multipliers and
                the fourth value is the angle (in degrees) of the
                rotation(s).</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Example: rotation 0 1 0 90.0 means the
                    object is rotated 90 degrees about the y-axis,
                    relative to the world-axis.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Scale (Xm,Ym,Zm) - Three floating point values
                representing a relative scaling. The values act as
                multipliers of the object's default dimension(s) in
                the indicated axes.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Example: scale 1 1 2 means that this object
                    will be twice as tall as the default when
                    loaded into the world.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Note: These values correspond indirectly to
                    those you see when mouse-scaling. Mouse scaling
                    values are actual world dimension.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>shapeName (shapes only) - This parameter's name
                is a misnomer. It actually gives the relative path
                and filename of the selected shape.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>interiorFile (interiors only) - This parameter
                gives the relative path and filename of the
                selected interior.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Object Name - There isn't actually a parameter
                tag for <em>Object Name</em>, but there is an
                editable text-field for it. The text-field is
                located to the right of the Apply button (see image
                below). You can type just about anything (no spaces
                allowed, so my text in the illustration is bad.) in
                this field and click apply to name your object.
                Note: Objects can be given the same name. We'll
                leave further discussion of object naming for a
                later chapter. Just remember, this is how you
                change it from the inspector.</p>

            <p>I won't explain what dynamic fields are yet, but
            rather explain a way they can be added. I will however
            say that dynamic fields are an important feature
            related to scripting and that you are very likely to
            use them. That said,</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>To Add a Dynamic Field</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Select the object which you wish to add a
                    field to.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Click the ADD button found in the Dynamic
                    Fields section of the world editor inspector
                    window.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>In the dialog pops up (below), give the
                    field a meaningful and unique name and an
                    initial value.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

            <ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Same as changing the value of any other
                    field. Just modify the contents of the
                    text-field next to the Dynamic Field name and
                    click APPLY.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>To delete the Dynamic Field</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Click on the check-box next to the Dynamic
                    field (see picture below) and the field will be
                    removed permanently. This <em>cannot be
                    undone</em>.</p>
                  </li>
