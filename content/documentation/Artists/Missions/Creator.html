        <p>This tool is used to create (or place) new content. From
        the World Editor Creator we can select objects to insert
        into our current mission.</p>

        <p>The top-level folders are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Interior - Buildings and other interiors.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Environmental stuff like the sky, sun,
                water.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Mission stuff like MissionArea, Triggers, and

        <p>Creating new objects is very like pasting objects.
        Simply,</p>

        <div class="procedure">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Move to the location in the mission area where you
            would like to place the object.</li>

            <li>Look approximately where you want to place the
            object (there is no pre-placement positioning feedback
            unfortunately - i.e. X does not mark the spot.).</li>

            <li>Find the object you wish to place by looking in the
            World Editor Creator Tree.</li>

            <li>Click once on the object in the list.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p>Once an object is placed in the world, you can freely
        manipulate its position, rotation, and scale via the mouse.
        If, however, you want to change object parameters, you'll
        need to switch back to the Inspector.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section"><a name="missioneditor.creator.tips"></a><a name = "HeaderLink3"></a>        Creator Tips</h2>

        <p>There will be a FAQ later in the appendix that deals
        with common stumbling blocks, but I'm going to list a few
        issues here because they are so very common, and this is a
        natural place to discuss them.</p>

        <p><em>Q</em>: "I placed an INTERIOR and the textures did
        not show up. Why?"</p>

        <p><em>A</em>: Unlike SHAPES, the INTERIORS do not
        immediately display their textures when inserted into the
        world. They have to be processed by the lighting stage
        (remember the message <em>Lighting Mission</em> when
        starting the mission?). Once you have placed an INTERIOR,
        press ALT + L to re-light the scene. This may take a few
        seconds, depending on the complexity/size/density of the
        mission.</p>

        <p><em>Q</em>: "How can I accurately place my objects the
        first time?"</p>

        <p><em>A</em>: Initial object placement is determined by
        line of sight. There are three basic placement cases. In
        the first two cases, a ray is cast from the eye of the
        camera/player until it hits the bounding box of another
        Mission Object or the Terrain/Water. In either of these
        cases, the object is placed at the point of collision. The
        third case is when the eye of the camera/player is aimed at
        the sky. In this case, the ray-cast fails (no-collision)
        and the object is placed at root of the ray (i.e. where you
        are looking from). Regarding bounding box collisions. I
        wouldn't count on those always working. I've had many cases
        where the ray collided with the ground instead of the
        intended target in front of the ground. Just get used to
        the idea that you will have to finesse things into the
        right location after placing them.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section"><a name=
        "missioneditor.creator.creatortree"></a><a name = "HeaderLink4"></a>Adding Object to         Creator Tree</h2>

        <p>If you have been exploring the <em>example/fps</em>
        directory, you may have noticed a similarity between the
        layout of the directories and the Creator's hierarchy. That
        is because there is a dependency (mostly for interiors). A
        more thorough discussion of this will be given in Tech
        School.</p>

        <div class="table">
          <a name="AEN1019"></a> 

          <p><b>Table 1-21.</b></p>

          <table border="0" class="CALSTABLE">
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td width="50%" align="LEFT" valign="MIDDLE">
                  <p><img src="images/creatortree.png"></p>
                </td>

                <td width="50%" align="LEFT" valign="MIDDLE">
                  <p><img src="images/explorer.png"></p>
                </td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td width="50%" align="LEFT" valign="MIDDLE">World
                Editor Creator</td>

                <td width="50%" align="LEFT" valign="MIDDLE">vs.
                Windows Explorer</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>Although a complete discussion on adding new interiors
        and shapes is beyond the scope of this section of the
        guide, I will outline the most basic steps required to get
        new INTERIORS and SHAPES into the Creator Tree.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section"><a name=
        "missioneditor.creator.addinteriors"></a><a name = "HeaderLink5"></a>Adding Interiors         To Creator Tree</h2>

        <p>Torque needs the following files to create an
        Interior:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>DIF - Once an interior has been properly generated,
            there will be a file named interior_name.dif, where
            interior_name is whatever you chose to name your
            interior object.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Graphic File(s) - A non-transparent interior will
            have at least one graphic file. By default, the graphic
            files used for the interior need to be located in a
            directory above the interior's DIF file or in the same
            directory as the DIF file.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Example:</p>

        <div class="procedure">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>In the directory: <em>
            example\egt\data\interiors\abcshack</em>you will find a
            file named abcshack.dif. Make a copy of this file and
            rename it: myabcshack.dif.</li>

            <li>Completely exit the SDK, re-load it, and start the
            Mission Editor mission again.</li>

            <li>Now, in the Creator Tree, under <em>Interiors -&gt;
            egt -&gt; data -&gt; Interiors -&gt; abcshack</em>you
            will see a new Interior named: <em>myabcshack</em>. Try
            placing it.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="mediaobject">
          <p><img src="images/creatortreeinterior.png"></p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section"><a name=
        "missioneditor.creator.addshape"></a><a name = "HeaderLink6"></a>Adding Shapes To         Creator Tree</h2>

        <p>Torque needs the following files to create a Shape:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>DTS - Once a shape has been properly generated,
            there will be a file named shape_name.dts, where
            shape_name is the whatever you chose to name your shape
            object.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Graphic File(s) - A non-transparent shape will have
            at least one graphic file. By default, the graphic
            files used for the shape need to be located in the same
            directory as the shape's DTS file.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>DSQ(s) (optional) - For an animated shape created in
            Max (does not apply to shapes created with Milkshape),
            there is a third type of file, containing animation
            data. For simplicity sake, this will not be discussed
            here, other than to note that they may exist. By
            default, the DSQ file(s) used for the shape need to be
            located in the same directory as the shape's DTS
            file.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Example:</p>

        <div class="procedure">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>In the directory: <em>
            example\egt\data\shapes\Simple</em>you will find a file
            named cube.dts. Make a copy of this file and rename it:
            mycube.dts.</li>

            <li>Completely exit the SDK, re-load it, and start the
            Mission Editor mission again.</li>

            <li>Now, in the Creator Tree, under <em>Static Shapes
            -&gt; egt -&gt; data -&gt; Shapes -&gt; Simple</em>you
            will see a new Shape named: <em>mycube</em>. Try
            placing it.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="mediaobject">
          <p><img src="images/creatortreeshape.png"></p>
        </div>

        <p>You might be wondering why the object showed up in <em>
        Static Shapes</em> instead of <em>Shapes</em>. Objects
        under Static Shapes are lightweight objects. Additionally,
        you can do some scripting to create objects with animations
        and other characteristics. They will show up under Shapes.
        You'll learn more about this in the <em>On The Job
        Training</em> chapter. For now, let us move on to the
        Mission Area Editor.</p>
