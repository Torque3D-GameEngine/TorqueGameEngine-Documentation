<h2 class="style1">Torque Game Engine (TGE) Documentation Overview</h2>
<p class="style1">As a TGE user, you have a <em>ton</em> of great documentation and tutorials   available to you!
This page offers a quick overview of what's available. </p>
<p class="style1">There are two main places to get detailed TGE documentation: online at the
<a href="http://tdn.garagegames.com/wiki/TorqueGameEngine" target="_blank">Torque   Developer Network</a> (TDN) and
here in the TGE SDK installation on your hard   drive itself. The Torque Developer Network is a vibrant, community-oriented
online documentation site for TGE and other GarageGames technologies. More   information on the documentation available
in each place is available in the   table below. </p>
<p class="style1">All told, TGE ships with over 300 pages of documentation right in the SDK!   And sinceit's all in
html format, you can now cross-reference all the functions and glossary terms with just a click! Of course, you should
know that you don't need to read <em>all</em> of this   information to get started with TGB. In fact, just the opposite is
true! Most   people just read a few tutorials and start working on their own from there.   That's all you really need to
do... and if you end up having questions later,   you can search for answers in the excellent documentation here in the
SDK, and online. </p>
<p class="style1">Please note as well that all the documents available here in the TGE SDK are   also avialable online
at the <a href="http://tdn.garagegames.com/wiki/TorqueGameEngine" target="_blank">Torque   Developer Network</a>. </p>
